    <h2>Samuel A Hiebert</h2>
    <p>My name is Samuel A Hiebert. I am a CIT Major, and I plan to go into Cyberseurity as my proffession. I enjoy cooking, reading, writing, and various board games and video games. 
    One of my favorite of these hobbies is Dungeons and Dragons. I am a member of a group called the Suboptimal Adventurers. We stream DnD every week on twitch, and we have a YouTube channel. 
    Currently, I am engaged to a wonderful woman name Shelby. She is also a meber of this streaming group. While Going to school, I am working at the Taco Time in Rexburg, Idaho. 
    I love the food and the work place we have. My coworkers and employers are great.</p>
    <p>What I love most about BYU-I is the community we live in to attend. I have lived in Madison County most of my life, and I love Rexburg. I enjoy the spirit that can be found here if one just looks for it, or even brings it. 
    At BYU-I we have a way of learning that is unique in most of this world. Our learning focuses on centering Christ in all we do. And I love that.</p>
    <p>I am taking this course to further my understanding of html code, and its applications in our modern day. Our world is becoming more and more technilogical, so we must match its speed or we'll be left behind. 
    I plan to use the information I learn here to build websites for various purposes. The biggest one being to help advertise for my YouTube and twitch channels. But I know the importance of learnig how to create a space to share information.</p>
